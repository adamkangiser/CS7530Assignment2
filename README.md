# Python was used to create the F function. Please see commented code for more detail. 
# The F-function, or the Feistel function, is a crucial component of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. It operates on a 32-bit input, known as the right half of the block (Ri), and a 48-bit round key (Ki) derived from the main encryption key. The F-function applies a series of operations to mix and transform the input, resulting in a 32-bit output.
